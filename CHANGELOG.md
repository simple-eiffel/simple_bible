# Changelog

All notable changes to simple_bible are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Tests run from any folder.** `SOURCE_SCAN` read the engine ECF and sources relative to the working folder, so the layering and purity tests failed when the suite ran from elsewhere (found by a design-debate spike). Paths now resolve against `SOURCE_SCAN.root`: the working folder when it holds `simple_bible.ecf`, otherwise `$SIMPLE_EIFFEL/simple_bible`. Verified from both locations: 69 pass, 47 skeletal, 0 fail, 0 warnings.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06 — design and engine contracts

### Added

- **Research** (`.eiffel-workflow/research/`): scope, landscape (53 sources), requirements, decisions D-001 to D-020, innovations, risks and recommendation; plus a harvest ledger for retiring simple_scholar, a feature-parity study of e-Sword and Logos, innovations drawn from practice, a world-timeline design with a 61-event pilot, a Septuagint source plan (Swete by default), and a user-voice study (294 items, 96 sources).
- **GUI spec** (`.eiffel-workflow/gui/`): layout and operation on native simple_widgets. A Simple mode (three-pane reader) and a Study mode (docked panels, link sets). 14 panels, 10 dialogs, 25 SVG mockups, the state machine, and 26 simple_widgets gap work items.
- **Specification** (`.eiffel-workflow/spec/`, 8 steps) and the approved **intent** (`intent-v2.md`, 57 Release 1a and 10 Release 1b acceptance criteria).
- **Engine library contracts** (Phase 1): 150 `BIB_*` classes, 16 deferred, with full contracts, MML model queries on all 53 collection attributes and 32 `|=|` frame conditions. "The engine owns every fact" is enforced through `BIB_SOURCED`, `fact_closure` postconditions on 27 features, mandatory provenance keys, four-bucket census and shape results, and restricted creation of mapped references and AI text.
- **Tests**: 21 test classes, 116 tests (69 pass, 47 skeletal reported as SKIP, 0 fail), plus a SCOOP consumer test. Compile gate: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

### Known gaps (to fill in fleet libraries)

- SQLite in eiffel_sqlite_2025 is 3.31.1, and its externals are not marked `blocking`.
- No Unicode normalization in the fleet yet (simple_encoding). Search normalization waits on it.
- simple_hash takes only 8-bit paths.
